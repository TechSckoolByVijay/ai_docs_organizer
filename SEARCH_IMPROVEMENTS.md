# Search Implementation Updates ‚úÖ

The search functionality has been updated to use Azure AI Search semantic search capabilities based on the working notebook implementation.

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- Added `AZURE_SEARCH_MIN_SCORE` environment variable (default: 0.5)
- Configurable filtering threshold without code changes
- Added to both backend and worker services in docker-compose.yml

### 2. Azure Search Service Updates (`azure_search.py`)
- Implemented semantic search using REST API calls (like notebook)
- Added fallback to simple search when semantic config is missing
- Configurable minimum score filtering
- Rich search results with scores and captions
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Search Service Integration (`search.py`)
- Updated to handle new Azure search response format
- Added search metadata to Document objects (score, caption)
- Improved error handling with fallback to local search
- Better performance logging

### 4. Schema Updates (`schemas.py`)
- Added `search_score` and `search_caption` fields to DocumentResponse
- UI can now display search relevance and snippets

## Benefits of These Changes:

### üéØ **Better Search Quality**
- Semantic search understands context and intent better than keyword matching
- Supports natural language queries like "get me warranty cards" or "find health related docs"
- Handles synonyms and related terms automatically

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Scoring**
- Environment-based threshold allows tuning without code changes
- Can adjust `AZURE_SEARCH_MIN_SCORE` based on content quality needs
- Easy to experiment with different thresholds

### üñ•Ô∏è **Rich UI Display**
- Search scores help users understand result relevance
- Captions provide context snippets for each result
- Better user experience with more informative search results

### üõ°Ô∏è **Fallback Resilience**
- Graceful degradation when semantic configuration is missing
- Falls back to simple search mode automatically
- Local search as final fallback if Azure is unavailable

## API Response Format

The search now returns results with additional metadata:

```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "original_filename": "warranty_card.pdf",
      "category": "warranty",
      "search_score": 0.847,
      "search_caption": "This warranty card covers electronic devices...",
      // ... other document fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 5,
  "query": "warranty cards",
  "execution_time_ms": 120
}
```

## Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
AZURE_SEARCH_MIN_SCORE=0.5  # Adjust based on your needs (0.0-1.0)
```

Higher values = more strict filtering, fewer but more relevant results
Lower values = more permissive, more results but potentially less relevant

## Testing the Implementation

The search functionality now works with natural language queries like:
- "get me warranty cards"
- "show my ID cards"  
- "find all health related docs"
- "retrieve medical bills"
- "show car insurance papers"

Results are filtered by the minimum score threshold and include rich metadata for better UI presentation.
