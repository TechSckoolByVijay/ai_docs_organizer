You are helping me build a FastAPI backend for managing receipts, ID cards, warranty cards, medical prescriptions, insurance papers PDFs and any other important docs.
Use Python 3.10, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.
Structure the code with models, routers, and services folders.
Each endpoint must return JSON responses with status and message.
We must have docker compose file to start the project easily.

Write code with proper comments, and easy syntax.

The terminal you are using is of Powershell. so always create PowerShel commands and not shell scripts.


For testing always use below account:
'{"username": "testuser2", "password": "testpassword123"}'
